Moved actual processing of new name into new method: ProcessTemplate
Added template processing, default template matches original code
Added new settings options:
	addAlways
	addToFirstVessel
	Minimum # of digits for launch number
	Minimum # of digits for bloc number
	ActiveOnLaunchpad
	ActiveOnRunway
	ActiveOnExternalLaunchpad (used by EPL)

Template Definition
	There are three fields available:
		name
		launchNumber
		blocNumber

	The template is case sensitive
	Each field is surrounded by matching braces and brackets
	Text between the brace and the bracket is only added to the vessel name if the field is used (ie:  bloc number isn't always used)

	Example:
		If the original vessel name is "Mercury", this is the second launch of block 2:
		This template:

			{[name]}{-[launchNumber]}{ (Bloc [blocNumber])}

		will produce the following vessel name:

			Mercury-2 (Bloc 2)
