	ActiveOnLaunchpad
	ActiveOnRunway

Template Definition
	There are three fields available:
		name
		launchNumber
		blocNumber

	The template is case sensitive
	Each field is surrounded by matching braces and brackets
	Text between the brace and the bracket is only added to the vessel name if the field is used (ie:  bloc number isn't always used)

	Example:
		If the original vessel name is "Mercury", this is the second launch of block 2:
		This template:

			{[name]}{-[launchNumber]}{ (Bloc [blocNumber])}

		will produce the following vessel name:

			Mercury-2 (Bloc 2)
